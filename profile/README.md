# Rust for Texas Instruments MSPM0 microcontrollers

This organization exists to host crates for using MSPM0 microcontrollers in Rust.

At the moment this project is focusing on adding an MSPM0 HAL to [embassy].

For more direct use of the hardware, you may be interested in the `mspm0-metapac`
crate (currently not released).
